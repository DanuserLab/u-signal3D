% INPUTS:
%
% PSF - a 3D point spread function larger than imageSize
%
% imageSize - the size of the 3D image for which a PSF is needed. Must be
%             the same size or smaller than the PSF.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%
% smallOTF - an optical transfer function sized to the image size
%
% newImageSize - the size images will be cropped to if they are larger than
%                the PSF

% the saved PSF must be the same size or larger than the images
