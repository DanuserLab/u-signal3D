function vertexIntensities = measureIntenistyVertex(image3D, surface, radius)
% measureIntensity - measures the image intensity near each vertex of a mesh
%
%INPUT
% image3D      3D (raw)image or imageSurface from uShape3D
% surface      triangle mesh surface with two structures: faces & vertices
% radius       a radius of a sphere for averaging the intensity around each
%              vertex (in pixels)
%OUPUT
% vertexIntensities     a vertex with mean field to emphasize we used "mean"
%                       of intensity within a sphere with a given radius on
%                       each vertex
