function N = readNEIGH(filename)
  % READNEIGH  Read tetrahedral neighbor information from a .neigh file (as
  % produced by tetgen)
  % 
  % N = readNEIGH(filename)
  %
  % Inputs:
  %   filename  path to .neigh file
  % Outputs:
  %   N  #simplices by #size-of-simplex neighborhood information (-1) indicates
  %     boundary. T(i,j) *should* indicate the neighbor to the jth face of the
  %     ith tet. *However* tetgen does not seem consistent. Consider
  %     post-processing with fixNEIGH.m
