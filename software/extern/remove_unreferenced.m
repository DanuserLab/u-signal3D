function [RV,IM,J,IMF] = remove_unreferenced(V,F)
  % REMOVE_UNREFERENCED Removes any rows in V that are not referenced in R.
  % **Warning:** This implementation is O(#V) regardless of #F
  %
  % [RV,IM,J,IMF] = remove_unreferenced(V,F)
  %
  % Inputs:
  %   V  #V by dim list of "vertex positions"
  %   F  #F by anything list of indices into V (will be treated as F(:))
  % Outputs:
  %  RV  #unique(F) by dim vertex positions, order such that if the jth vertex is
  %    some face in F, and the kth vertex is not then j comes before k
  %  IM  #V by 1 list of indices such that: RF = IM(F) and RT = IM(T)
  %    and V(find(IM~=-1),:) = RV
  %  J  #RV by 1 list, such that RV = V(J,:)
  % 
  % Examples:
  %   % Tet mesh in (V,T,F)
  %   [RV,I] = remove_unreferenced(V,[T(:);F(:)]);
  %   T = I(T);
  %   F = I(F);
  %   ... % do some computation on RV
  %   % replace back into V
  %   V(find(IM<=size(SV,1)),:) = V
