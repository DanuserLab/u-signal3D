function [V,E,H,h] = poly2VEH(poly)
  % POLY2VEH convert poly struct array to vertex, edge and hole lists
  %
  % [V,E,H,h] = poly2VEH(poly)
  % Input:
  %   poly struct array for each component of polygon boundary. Each struct
  %     contains a loop of vertices (x,y) and a flag for whether this is an
  %     inner hole
  % Output:
  %   V  #V by 2 list of polygon vertices
  %   E  #E by 2 list of polygon edge indices
  %   H  #H by 2 list of hole positions
  %
  % This has the problem that it is throwing away the information about which
  % sets of edges are inner boundaries
