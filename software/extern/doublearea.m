function dblA = doublearea(V,F)
  % DOUBLEAREA Compute the double area of the triangles of a mesh
  %
  % dblA = doublearea(V,F)
  %
  % Inputs:
  %  V #V x dim matrix of vertex coordinates
  %  F #F x 3  matrix of indices of triangle corners
  % Outputs:
  %  dblA   #F list of twice the area of each corresponding face. For dim = 2
  %    this is a signed quantity
