function [signalMean, signalMax, signalSTD, backgroundMean, backgroundSTD] = cellSignalAndBackground(image3D, imageBlurSize, sphereErodeSE, sphereDilateSE)

% cellSignalAndBackground - estimates the mean and standard deviation of both the signal and background by assuming an image of uniformly lit objects
%
% Blurs and then Otsu thresholds the image. Erodes the image and then sets
% the mean intensity of the eroded image to be the magnitude of the signal. 
% Dilates the thresholded image and then sets the standard deviation 
% outside the dilated region to be the noise.

%
% sphereErodeSE  - the structuring element for the erosion operation
