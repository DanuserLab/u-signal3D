function image = make3DImageVoxelsSymmetric(image,pixXY,pixZ)
%MAKE3DIMAGEVOXELSSYMMETRIC scales the input 3D image so that the voxels are symmetric 
% 
% image = make3DImageVoxelsSymmetric(image,pixXY,pixZ)
% 
% This function scales the input 3D image matrix so that the resulting
% voxels are symmetric, allowing pixel-level calculations (e.g. distance
% transform) to be calculated correctly. By symmetric it is meant that the
% physical dimensions of the voxels in each dimension. This is done based
% on the input pixel sizes in X-Y and Z. It is assumed that the last
% dimension of the matrix is the Z axis, and that the pixel sizes in the X
% and Y directions are equal. The scaling is done in the Z-direction, so
% that the resulting matrix is the same size in the first two dimensions,
% but larger in the third dimension.
%   This function is intended to be used to pre-process 3D image data where
% the spacing between z-planes is not equal to the pixel size in X-Y. The
% units of the input pixel sizes are unimportant, as only the relative
% sizes are used in scaling.
%
% Input:
% 
%   image - 3D image matrix.
% 
%   pixXY - Positive scalar specifying the size of the pixels in the X-Y
%   plane (dimensions 1,2)
% 
%   pixZ - Positive scalar specifying the size of the pixels in the z
%   direction (dimension 3)
% 
% 
% Output:
%
%   image - 3D matrix containing symmetric voxels, whose sizes in the x,y
%   and z directions are all equal to the input pixel size in the x-y
%   direction, pixXY.
